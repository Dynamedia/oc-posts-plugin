Brief notes for issues found in testing

Fix relation manager slug relation from inside of another relation manager (probably just remove for now)

Add method for themes to hint views for body rendering

Attempt to redirect tag pages on language change (url section)

Ensure backend users have profiles set - For author/editor dropdowns and posts by user page

Ensure no duplicate translations and no translation into native language

Create classes for rendering SEO more cleanly



Think about writing some tests - :)
